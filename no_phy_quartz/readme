Some ebaz4205 have no 25 MHz quartz for ethernet PHY (IPI101GA).
With original buildroot sd card, linux boots normally but eth0 is not detected !

Use the original SD card. Erase BOOT.bin and copy the new BOOT.bin
Now eth0 device is detected ...

You will find the final BOOT.bin here.

=============

You need to install Xilinx Vivado and Vitis tools.

Solution:
Some ebaz4205 have no 25 MHz quartz for ethernet PHY (IPI101GA).
But Zynq U18 pin is connected to ethernet PHY clock input (xout). 
=> 25 MHz must be provided by Zynq PL. 

One solution is to divide by 2 the FCLK_CLK0 Zynq7 processing system clock (50 MHz).
For this function, I use a "counter_binary" block with only one bit.

So you need to modify BOOT.bin file in the SD card.
In Xilinx Vitis import the hardware (block_design.xsa) and create a dummy project.
You will find a zynq_fsbl directory with source code.
Copy main.c, uboot_loader.h , uboot_loader.c in it. Build to create a fsbl.elf file
Create the BOOT.bin file using fsbl.elf (bootloader) and block_design.bit
